        <h2>Binge-Watcher</h2>
        <p>
            In my spare time, I look at an assortment of media. It could be Hulu, Youtube, or Netflix. Anything with entertainment catches my attention. My favorite platform would be Youtube and I like to look at gaming videos. Playthough of a log game is how I would like to close out my day.

        <h2>Drawing</h2>
        <p>
            I like to draw and sketch on my iPad to pass the time. My favorite style is cartoon-like portfolios. The exaggerated features allows me to express myself more that realism. One of my drawinf could be seen on the right.
